PF4J can be used in Kotlin project as well. One has to use the Kotlin annotation processing tool 
[**kapt**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html) for the plugin project written in Kotlin.  
The demo_gradle project contains one plugin project _plugin3_ written in Kotlin for demonstration.
