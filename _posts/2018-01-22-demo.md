I have a tiny demo application. The demo application is in [demo](https://github.com/srbala/srbala/tree/master/demo) folder.  
In `demo/api` folder I declared an extension point (_Greeting_).  
In `demo/plugins` I implemented two plugins: __plugin1__, __plugin2__ (each plugin adds an extension for _Greeting_).  

To run the demo application use:  

```
./run-demo.sh (for Linux/Unix)
./run-demo.bat (for Windows)
```
